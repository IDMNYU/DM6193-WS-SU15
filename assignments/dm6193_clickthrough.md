* Beginners: Do NOT use a framework.
* Intermediate/Advanced: Using a Framework of your choice
<br><br>
Using your sitemap, create the skeleton of the directory structure of your site by creating all corresponding folders and files. At the very least there should be a persistent, main navigation (nav) on every page linking to the corresponding pages of your main nav. Every page of your site should be represented. 
* There should be index.html files in every folder.
* There should be at least css, js, and images folders in the root directory. Optionally, a scss or sass folder.
* There should be images folders as needed in each directory.
* You should commit to github.
