## Clickthrough / Skeleton

*Beginners: Do NOT use a framework.
Intermediate/Advanced: Using a Framework of your choice*
<br><br>
Using your sitemap, create the skeleton of the directory structure of your site by creating all corresponding folders and files. At the very least there should be a persistent, main navigation (nav) on every page linking to the corresponding pages of your main nav. Every page of your site should be represented. 
<ul>
<li>There should be index.html files in every folder.</li>
<li>There should be at least css, js, and images folders in the root directory. Optionally, a scss or sass folder.</li>
<li>There should be images folders as needed in each directory.</li>
<li>You should commit to github.</li>
</ul>
