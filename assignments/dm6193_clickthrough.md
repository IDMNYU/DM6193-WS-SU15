## Clickthrough / Skeleton

* *Beginners: Do NOT use a framework.*
* *Intermediate / Advanced: Using a Framework of your choice*

* Using your sitemap, create the skeleton of the directory structure of your site by creating all corresponding folders and files. 
* At the very least there should be a persistent, main navigation (nav) on every page linking to the corresponding pages of your main nav. 
* Every page of your site should be represented.
* There should be index.html files in every folder.
* There should be at least css, js, and images folders in the root directory. Optionally, a scss or sass folder if you're using the foundation framework.
* There should be images folders as needed in each directory.
* Add as much content (text, images, video, etc.) as possible.
* No additional CSS styling.
* (OPTIONAL at this point) CSS positioning. Do the following tutorial: http://learnlayout.com (before adding CSS positioning.) 
* You should commit to github.
