## MOOD BOARD

<p>Read the following first: http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2008/12/why-mood-boards-matter</p>

<p>Create your mood board using photoshop or another application of your choice.</p>
<p>Use the Template Mood Board (NOT the collage mood board) in the link below as a guide. The only thing that is missing from the Template Mood Board guide is the functionality or interactivity you’d also like to include in your site.</p>
