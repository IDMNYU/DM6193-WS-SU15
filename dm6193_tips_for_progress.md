## Tips for Progress

* Get ready to be frustrated. This is an integral part of learning. Everyone makes mistakes; you will too. It is ok.

* Don’t give up when something gets hard. Keep at it.

* Read and/or watch everything you can (multiple resources on the same topic give you different perspectives). Watch and learn from the mistakes you make. These are prime ways to improve your skills. You will continue to learn even if you have been at it for a long time.

* View Source. Look at other people’s code and ways that they organized it. How easy is other’s code to read through?

* Learn Relative Paths.

* Acquire and Use a HTML, CSS, Framework tag list or cheat sheet. 

* index.html in each folder (except images folder). why?
  * Server can be setup so that this is the default page within a directory
